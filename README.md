# LIP_Blog

This repository is where I will display my learning in public! LIP posts are meant to help me fully think through the projects I take on as well as display my growing skills as I learn to code. My hope is to learn more deeply and possibly connect with others along the way! I would love to grow through constructive feedback from those more advanced in the field.
